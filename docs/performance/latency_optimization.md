# Latency Optimization Document

This document outlines the strategies and results for optimizing the neural network inference and overall system latency.

## Current Latency Measurements

- Perception network inference: [X] ms
- Policy network inference: [Y] ms
- End-to-end perception-to-action: [Z] ms

## Optimization Strategies Implemented

- Model quantization
- Hardware acceleration (e.g., TensorRT)
- Efficient data transfer (e.g., shared memory)

## Future Work

- Further model compression
- Asynchronous processing
