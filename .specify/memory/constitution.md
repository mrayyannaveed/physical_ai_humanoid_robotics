# Physical AI & humanoid robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Co-designed Motion and Intelligence
Motion and intelligence must be co-designed, not isolated. The physical and cognitive aspects of the robot are deeply intertwined and must be developed in a unified manner.

### II. Continuous Perception-Action Loops
Perception loops must influence action continuously. The robot must constantly perceive its environment and adapt its actions in real-time based on new information.

### III. Inherent Safety Boundaries
All autonomy must include safety boundaries. Every autonomous action or decision must operate within a predefined set of safety constraints that cannot be overridden.

### IV. Human & Ethical Alignment
Human compatibility and ethical alignment are mandatory. The robot's goals, behaviors, and decision-making processes must be aligned with human values and ethical principles.

### V. Observable Safe Failure
Robots must fail safely and be observable. In the event of a failure, the robot must default to a safe state, and its internal states and decision-making processes must be accessible for analysis.

## Core Pillars

This section defines the foundational pillars of the project.
- **Physics-aware AI**: AI models and algorithms must be grounded in the principles of physics to ensure realistic and safe interactions with the physical world.
- **Embodiment**: The physical form of the robot is central to its intelligence and capabilities.
- **Human-centric Safety**: Safety is not just a feature but the core design principle, with a focus on human-well-being.

## Key Foundational Details

This section outlines key influences, mindsets, and metrics for the.
- **Influence Roots**: Inspired by early robot governing laws introduced conceptually by Isaac Asimov.
- **Modern Safety Mindset**: Aligned with AI safety research principles from labs like OpenAI.
- **Success Metrics**: Success is measured by safety-first autonomy, real-time learning capabilities, and a scalable architecture.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, formal approval, and a clear migration plan. All pull requests and reviews must verify compliance with this constitution.
