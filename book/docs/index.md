# Table of Contents

Welcome to "Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics: An Engineer's Guide to Embodied Intelligence". This book provides a comprehensive, engineer-focused exploration of the principles, technologies, and practices required to design, build, and program advanced humanoid robots.

## Chapter 1: Foundations of Physical AI
- **[Introduction to Physical AI](./chapter-1/01-introduction.md)**: Defines Embodied AI, its significance, and the core challenges in bridging the gap between digital intelligence and physical interaction.
- **[History and Evolution of Humanoid Robotics](./chapter-1/02-history-and-evolution.md)**: A technical timeline of key milestones, from early automatons to the latest AI-driven platforms like Boston Dynamics' Atlas and Tesla's Optimus.
- **[Core Concepts of Embodied Intelligence](./chapter-1/03-core-concepts.md)**: Explores the foundational principles, including the perception-action loop, morphological computation, and the role of physical embodiment in learning.

## Chapter 2: Humanoid Robot Design and Kinematics
- **[Mechanical Design and Materials](./chapter-2/01-mechanical-design-and-materials.md)**: Covers structural design considerations, material selection (e.g., composites, alloys), and trade-offs between weight, strength, and cost.
- **[Kinematics and Dynamics](./chapter-2/02-kinematics-and-dynamics.md)**: A mathematical treatment of forward and inverse kinematics, Denavit-Hartenberg parameters, and Lagrangian dynamics for multi-body systems.
- **[Actuators and Sensors](./chapter-2/03-actuators-and-sensors.md)**: Details on state-of-the-art actuator technologies (e.g., quasi-direct drive, series elastic actuators) and the sensor suite required for proprioception and exteroception.

## Chapter 3: Perception and World Modeling
- **[Sensor Fusion Techniques](./chapter-3/01-sensor-fusion.md)**: Algorithms for integrating multi-modal sensor data (IMU, vision, LiDAR, torque) using filters like the Kalman Filter and its variants.
- **[Computer Vision for Robotics](./chapter-3/02-computer-vision-for-robotics.md)**: Focuses on real-time object detection, segmentation, and 3D reconstruction tailored for robotic interaction.
- **[Semantic World Modeling](./chapter-3/03-semantic-world-modeling.md)**: Discusses the creation of rich, semantic representations of the environment, enabling robots to reason about objects, spaces, and their affordances.

## Chapter 4: Planning, Control, and Learning
- **[Motion Planning Algorithms](./chapter-4/01-motion-planning-algorithms.md)**: An overview of sampling-based planners (RRT, RRT*), trajectory optimization, and whole-body motion planning.
- **[Advanced Control Systems](./chapter-4/02-advanced-control-systems.md)**: Explores modern control strategies, including Model Predictive Control (MPC), whole-body control, and operational space control.
- **[Reinforcement Learning and Sim-to-Real](./chapter-4/03-reinforcement-learning-and-sim-to-real.md)**: A practical guide to training policies in simulation (e.g., NVIDIA Isaac Sim) and transferring them to physical hardware using techniques like domain randomization.

## Chapter 5: System Integration, Testing, and Future Directions
- **[System Integration and ROS](./chapter-5/01-system-integration-and-ros.md)**: Best practices for integrating the various software and hardware components using the Robot Operating System (ROS 2).
- **[Testing and Validation](./chapter-5/02-testing-and-validation.md)**: Methodologies for systematically testing and validating robot performance, safety, and reliability.
- **[The Future of Humanoid Robotics](./chapter-5/03-the-future-of-humanoid-robotics.md)**: Explores emerging trends, including foundation models for robotics, multi-robot collaboration, and the path toward general-purpose humanoid robots.
