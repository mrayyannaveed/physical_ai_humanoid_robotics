We are thrilled to announce the launch of our new documentation site for "Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics: An Engineer's Guide to Embodied Intelligence"!

This book delves into the fascinating world where artificial intelligence meets the physical realm, focusing specifically on the challenges and breakthroughs in creating humanoid robots. Our aim is to provide engineers, researchers, and enthusiasts with a comprehensive resource covering everything from fundamental mechanical design to advanced AI-driven perception, planning, and control systems.

### What You'll Find Here

Over five detailed chapters, we explore:
- The historical journey and core concepts of embodied AI.
- The intricate mechanical and kinematic design principles of humanoids.
- State-of-the-art sensor fusion and computer vision techniques for understanding the world.
- Advanced control algorithms and the power of reinforcement learning for dynamic behaviors.
- The crucial role of simulation (Sim-to-Real), system integration with ROS 2, and the exciting future of humanoid robotics.

### Our Vision

Our world is designed by humans, for humans. Humanoid robots, with their versatile form factor, are uniquely positioned to navigate and operate within these environments without requiring costly infrastructure modifications. This book aims to equip you with the knowledge to build the next generation of these remarkable machines.

We invite you to explore the content, delve into the technical details, and join us on this journey to shape the future of embodied intelligence.
