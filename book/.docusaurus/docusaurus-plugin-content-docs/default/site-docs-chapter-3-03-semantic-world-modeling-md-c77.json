  "description": "For a humanoid robot to operate intelligently and robustly in complex, human-centric environments, it needs more than just a geometric map of its surroundings. It requires a semantic world model: an understanding of objects, their properties, their relationships, and their affordances (what actions they enable). This allows the robot to reason about its environment, plan high-level tasks, and interact more naturally with humans.",
