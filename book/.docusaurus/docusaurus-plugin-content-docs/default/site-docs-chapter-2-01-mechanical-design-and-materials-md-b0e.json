  "description": "The mechanical design of a humanoid robot is a study in trade-offs. The structure must be strong enough to withstand dynamic forces, yet lightweight enough for efficient locomotion. It must be complex enough to house a vast network of actuators, sensors, and electronics, yet simple enough to be manufactured and maintained at a reasonable cost.",
